## Summary

This lecture introduced the Medical Chinese course (EAM 212) and covered the opening passage of [[Sùwèn]] Chapter 5 on [[Yin and Yang]]. The class focused on translation methodology using OneLane software, key vocabulary, and recognizing classical grammar patterns. Core takeaway: Yin and Yang are described as the Dào of Heaven and Earth — the fundamental organizing principles governing all transformation, creation, and destruction in the universe.

## Translation Tools & Methodology

### Recommended Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **OneLane** | Primary translation software | Hover over characters to see definitions; can save custom entries |
| **Pleco** | Dictionary app | Draw characters if pinyin doesn't work; excellent for character lookup |
| **MDBG.net** | Web-based dictionary | Paste entire lines of text to see all definitions at once |
| **Eastland Press Glossary** | Reference | Draft glossary with pinyin — shared resource from Craig |

&nbsp;

> [!tip] OneLane Workflow
> 1. Paste text from Populi into OneLane
> 2. Save file immediately: `File → Save As → [Week#_Topic]`
> 3. Hover over characters to see definitions at bottom of screen
> 4. Click individual characters for detailed dictionary entries
> 5. Add custom definitions by clicking "enable editing" in the dictionary window

&nbsp;

### Translation Approach

> [!quote] Instructor Advice
> *"When you're doing translations and you're confused, look back at a Foundations book and look at what is possible of Yin and Yang... Use what you already know from Chinese medicine to inform your translation."*

**Step-by-step method:**

1. **First pass:** Look for grammar patterns (者 zhě, 也 yě, parallel structures)
2. **Separate sentences:** Use periods (。) and commas (，) as guides
3. **Word-by-word:** Hover over each character, note multiple meanings
4. **Pattern recognition:** Look for 5-character parallel phrases
5. **Rough draft:** Keep it choppy — don't over-interpret yet
6. **Refinement:** Make it sound natural in English

&nbsp;

> [!warning] Common Translation Pitfall
> Don't add too many extra words trying to make it "sound nice." Keep translations simple. `者 zhě` = "as for" and `也 yě` = "is" — don't embellish into "they act as" when "is" works fine.

## Grammar Patterns 文法

### The 者...也 (zhě...yě) Structure

This is the core pattern of classical Chinese topic-comment sentences.

```
[TOPIC] 者, [COMMENT] 也
```

&nbsp;

> [!important] Pattern Translation
> **者 zhě** = "As for..." (marks the topic)
> **也 yě** = "...is" (marks the comment/predicate)
> 
> Example: 陰陽者，天地之道也
> "As for Yin and Yang, [they] are the Dào of Heaven and Earth"

&nbsp;

### Parallel Construction 平行結構

Classical Chinese loves visual symmetry. Look for:
- **Same character count** per line (often 5 characters)
- **Mirrored structure** (noun-verb-noun patterns)
- **Implied 也** in subsequent lines after the first explicit one

&nbsp;

> [!example] Pattern Recognition
> ```
> 陰陽者，天地之道也     (5 chars + 也)
> 萬物之綱紀            (5 chars — 也 implied)
> 變化之父母            (5 chars — 也 implied)  
> 生殺之本始            (5 chars — 也 implied)
> 神明之府也            (4 chars + 也 for balance)
> ```
> All of these refer back to "As for Yin and Yang, [they] are..."

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Why This Matters
> *"Getting into the habit of looking for parallel construction is super important. A lot of times, if you see the parallel construction, the sentence or paragraph will make sense. If you don't see it, it won't."* — Craig

&nbsp;

### Conditional 則 (zé) — "If...Then"

When you see 則, look backwards for the "if" condition:

```
[CONDITION]，則 [RESULT]
"If [condition], then [result]"
```

Example: 清氣在下，則生飧泄
"If clear Qi is below, then [it] generates diarrhea"
