## Summary

This lecture introduced the Zàng Fǔ Herbs trimester, covering course structure, study methodology, and foundational organ theory. The class then began the [[Spleen]] unit, comparing two fundamental formulas: [[Lǐ Zhōng Tāng]] (Regulate the Middle Decoction) for Spleen Yáng deficiency with cold, and [[Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng]] (Four Gentlemen Decoction) for Spleen Qì deficiency. Key distinction: Lǐ Zhōng Tāng has Gān Jiāng (warming), while Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng substitutes Fú Líng (draining dampness).

## How to Study Herbs & Formulas

### For Formulas — Focus on These Sections:

| Section | What It Tells You |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Actions** | Summary of what the formula does |
| **Indications** | Signs & symptoms of the person who needs it |
| **Analysis** | Why it works — herb-by-herb breakdown |

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Study Priority
> *"If you can remember the name of the formula, its actions, what a person looks like who needs it, and have some insight into the interactions of the herbs — that would be very good."*

&nbsp;

The **Commentary** section (longer in newer edition) covers historical context, modifications, biomedical indications — helpful but secondary.

&nbsp;

### For Single Herbs — Focus on:

| Element | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Pinyin** | You need to know what you're talking about |
| **Properties** | Cold/Cool/Neutral/Warm/Hot |
| **Channels entered** | Where it acts |
| **Key characteristics** | The "shorthand sentence" of what it does |
| **Category** | Tells you primary action |

&nbsp;

> [!example] Differentiation Within Categories
> All herbs in "Relieve Food Stagnation" do that, but:
> - **Shān Zhā** 山楂 — better for greasy foods/meat
> - **Mài Yá** 麥芽 — better for grains
> 
> This level of differentiation can come later.

&nbsp;

## Zàng Fǔ Theory Overview

### Context: Three Frameworks Across the Year

| Trimester | Framework | Focus |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Fall | [[Shāng Hán Lùn]] | Attack by cold pathogen; Six Stages; progression & incorrect treatment |
| Winter | **Zàng Fǔ** | Organ pathologies; patterns of disharmony |
| Spring | Fluid Physiology | Metabolism of fluids; Spleen/Kidney function |

&nbsp;

> [!important] Key Difference from Shāng Hán
> **Shāng Hán Lùn** = one doctor's clinical experience; acute disease; wrong treatment can kill
> 
> **Zàng Fǔ** = hundreds of doctors over 1,500 years; chronic patterns; less emphasis on treatment errors

&nbsp;

### The Organs

**Yīn Organs (臟 Zàng):** Spleen, Lung, Heart, Liver, Kidney
- Most formulas relate to these
- Pericardium patterns exist (Wēn Bìng coma formulas) but not covered

**Yáng Organs (腑 Fǔ):** Stomach, Large Intestine, Small Intestine, Gallbladder, Urinary Bladder
- Paired with Yīn organs
- Fewer specific formulas

**Not Covered:**
- Pericardium (rare substances needed — ox gallstone, musk)
- Sān Jiāo (no specific Sān Jiāo formulas; it's a regional concept)

&nbsp;

### What Can Go Wrong with Organs

| Category | Types | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Deficiency** | Qì, Blood, Yīn, Yáng | Not all organs have all four types |
| **Stagnation** | Qì, Blood, (Fluids) | Pain is the key indicator |
| **Pathogenic Factors** | Cold, Heat, Dampness, Phlegm, Damp-Heat, Dryness, Wind | Can be external or internal |

&nbsp;

> [!warning] Deficiency vs. Excess Terminology
> **Deficiency** = 4 types (Qì, Blood, Yīn, Yáng)
> **Excess** = many types (Damp, Wind, Stagnation, Phlegm, Heat, Damp-Heat...)
> 
> Deficiency and Stagnation are *internal* — they don't invade from outside.

&nbsp;

### Eight Principles Still Apply

| Principle | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | Exterior ↔ Interior |
| Temperature | Hot ↔ Cold |
| Strength | Excess ↔ Deficient |
| Nature | Yáng ↔ Yīn |

&nbsp;

> [!example] Eight Principles in Practice
> - **Bái Hǔ Tāng** (Four Bigs): Interior, Hot, Excess → predominantly Yáng
> - **Sì Nì Tāng** (Shào Yīn Cold): Interior, Cold, Deficient → Yīn
> - **Huáng Lián È Jiāo Tāng** (Shào Yīn Heat): Interior, Hot, Mixed

---

&nbsp;

## Qì, Blood & Body Fluids Framework

### Qì Disharmonies

| Pattern | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Deficiency** | Insufficient function; fatigue |
| **Stagnation** | Pain (moving), bloating, emotional irritability |
| **Rebellion** | Going wrong direction — coughing, vomiting |
| **Sinking** | Spleen fails to lift clear Qì — prolapse, chronic diarrhea |

&nbsp;

### Blood Disharmonies

| Pattern | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Deficiency** | Paleness (complexion, nails, conjunctiva), dizziness, scanty menses |
| **Stasis** | Fixed sharp pain, dysmenorrhea, stabbing chest pain, purple clots |
| **Heat** | Red skin eruptions, excessive bright red menstrual bleeding |
| **Loss** | Bleeding — can be from Qì deficiency (pale), Heat (bright red), or Stasis (dark purple) |

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Blood Stasis Indicators
> - **Fixed pain** (vs. moving pain = Qì stagnation)
> - **Purple/dark clots** in menstrual blood
> - **Cramping that resolves** after passing clots

&nbsp;

### Body Fluid Disharmonies

| Pattern | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Deficiency** | Fluid deficiency → progresses to Yīn deficiency |
| **Edema** | Accumulation of water under skin |
| **Phlegm** | Pathological fluid — can be visible (coughing up) or invisible (wind-phlegm in channels → stroke, seizure) |

---

&nbsp;

## The Spleen 脾

### Core Functions

| Function | Clinical Relevance |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Transformation & Transportation** | Processes food essences; impairment → dampness accumulation |
| **Controls Blood** | Keeps blood in vessels; failure → bleeding (pale blood) |
| **Controls Muscles & Four Limbs** | Weakness, flaccidity, fatigue |
| **Governs Thought/Intellect** | Damaged by excessive thinking/studying |
| **Opens to Mouth & Lips** | Pale lips may indicate Spleen issue |

&nbsp;

### Spleen Correspondences

| Category | Correspondence |
|----------|----------------|
| Element | Earth 土 |
| Season | Late Summer |
| Pathogenic Factor | Dampness |
| Emotion | Pensiveness / Overthinking |
| Tissue | Muscles |
| Sense Organ | Mouth |

&nbsp;

> [!warning] What Damages the Spleen
> - **Poor diet** — junk food, cold/raw foods, dampness-promoting foods
> - **Overthinking** — excessive studying, worry, rumination
> - **Overwork OR underwork** — Spleen controls muscles
> - **Irregular eating** — Spleen likes regularity

&nbsp;

## Spleen Formulas Comparison

### Lǐ Zhōng Tāng 理中湯 vs. Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng 四君子湯

&nbsp;

| | **Lǐ Zhōng Tāng** | **Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng** |
|---|---|---|
| **English** | Regulate the Middle Decoction | Four Gentlemen Decoction |
| **Source** | Shāng Hán Lùn (Hàn Dynasty) | ~800 years later (Sòng Dynasty?) |
| **Pattern** | Spleen **Yáng** Deficiency | Spleen **Qì** Deficiency |
| **Key Feature** | Cold in middle burner | No pronounced cold |

&nbsp;

### Ingredient Comparison

| Herb | Lǐ Zhōng Tāng | Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng | Function |
|------|:-------------:|:--------------:|----------|
| **Rén Shēn** 人參 | ✓ | ✓ | Tonifies Qì of Spleen & Lung |
| **Bái Zhú** 白朮 | ✓ | ✓ | Tonifies Spleen Qì, dries dampness |
| **Zhì Gān Cǎo** 炙甘草 | ✓ | ✓ | Harmonizes, strengthens middle burner |
| **Gān Jiāng** 乾薑 | ✓ | ✗ | **HOT** — warms, dispels cold, mobilizes |
| **Fú Líng** 茯苓 | ✗ | ✓ | **Neutral** — drains dampness, promotes urination |

&nbsp;

> [!important] The Critical Swap
> **Gān Jiāng → Fú Líng** changes everything:
> - Removes the hot herb
> - Adds direct dampness drainage (vs. warming to resolve dampness)
> - Shifts from Yáng deficiency treatment to Qì deficiency treatment

&nbsp;

### Pattern Differentiation

| Sign/Symptom | Lǐ Zhōng Tāng | Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng |
|--------------|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| Fatigue | ✓ | ✓ |
| Loose stools/diarrhea | ✓ (may be severe) | ✓ |
| Poor appetite | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bloating | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Cold abdomen / worse with cold food** | ✓ | ✗ |
| **Undigested food in stool** | ✓ | ✗ |
| **Pronounced coldness** | ✓ | ✗ |
| Pale tongue, white greasy coat | ✓ | ✓ |

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Clinical Decision Point
> *"Undigested food in stool points more to Yáng deficiency — there's even less transformation going on because there's not enough Yáng to do the transformation."*

&nbsp;

## Lǐ Zhōng Tāng 理中湯 — Regulate the Middle Decoction

**Source:** [[Shāng Hán Lùn]] (Tài Yīn stage)

&nbsp;

### Ingredients (Memorize)

| Herb | Pinyin | Dosage | Role |
|------|--------|--------|------|
| 乾薑 | Gān Jiāng | 9g | Chief — warms middle, dispels cold, disperses dampness |
| 人參 | Rén Shēn | 9g | Chief — tonifies Qì of middle burner |
| 白朮 | Bái Zhú | 9g | Tonifies Spleen Qì, dries dampness |
| 炙甘草 | Zhì Gān Cǎo | 6g | Harmonizes, strengthens middle burner |

&nbsp;

### Pathomechanism

```
Cold penetrates middle burner (or constitutional weakness / cold diet)
        ↓
Impairs Spleen's transformation function
        ↓
Dampness accumulates → Qì stagnates
        ↓
Abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, vomiting
```

&nbsp;

### Indications

- Abdominal fullness and pain
- Vomiting, diarrhea
- Bleeding (Spleen failing to control blood)
- Fatigue, coldness
- Cold abdomen or aversion to cold food

&nbsp;

> [!important] Herb Pairs
> - **Gān Jiāng + Bái Zhú** = Warming + Drying
> - **Rén Shēn + Bái Zhú** = Tonifying Spleen Qì
> - **Zhì Gān Cǎo** = honey-fried version strengthens middle burner action

---

&nbsp;

## Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng 四君子湯 — Four Gentlemen Decoction

**Source:** Later text (~Sòng Dynasty)
**Status:** Cardinal formula for tonifying Spleen Qì

&nbsp;

### Ingredients (Memorize — it's in the name!)

| Herb | Pinyin | Dosage | Role |
|------|--------|--------|------|
| 人參 | Rén Shēn | 9g | Tonifies Qì of Spleen & Lung |
| 白朮 | Bái Zhú | 9g | Tonifies Spleen Qì, dries dampness |
| 茯苓 | Fú Líng | 9g | Promotes urination, drains dampness, calms |
| 炙甘草 | Zhì Gān Cǎo | 6g | Harmonizes, strengthens middle burner |

&nbsp;

### Pathomechanism

```
Overwork / Poor diet / Overthinking / Irregular eating
        ↓
Spleen Qì becomes deficient
        ↓
Weak transformation → dampness may accumulate
        ↓
Fatigue, poor appetite, loose stools, bloating
(No pronounced coldness)
```

&nbsp;

### Indications

- Fatigue, limb weakness
- Poor appetite
- Loose stools (not severe diarrhea)
- Bloating
- Pale tongue, possibly greasy white coat
- Weak pulse
- Pale complexion

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Classic Herb Pair
> **Fú Líng + Bái Zhú** = frequently paired to tonify Spleen and promote proper T&T

---

&nbsp;

## Clinical Pearls

> [!quote] On Dosing — The Qián Question
> *"A qián is considered about 3 grams in the PRC, but in Taiwan it's about 3.75 grams. That's why Jean Lai's formulas have lots of 7.5s and 11s — she's using 2 qián and 3 qián. I round to 3, so you see lots of 6s and 9s in my formulas. The ratios matter more than the absolute numbers."*

&nbsp;

> [!quote] On Granule Dosing
> With raw herbs, you calculate total grams per ingredient.
> With granules, you decide total daily dose first (e.g., 10g/day), then calculate ratios.
> 
> Example: 70g total for one week, want Guì Zhī Tāng + 10% each of two add-ons:
> - Base formula: 56g
> - Add-on herbs: 7g each

&nbsp;

> [!warning] Granule Mixing Issue
> PRC granules are "chunky," Taiwanese are finer. If mixed, chunky ones rise to top — patient may not get representative formula throughout. Don't mix textures unless patient shakes well before each dose.

&nbsp;

### The Psychic Cat Story

> [!quote] Lindsay's Cat Diagnosed Herself
> An animal communicator (remote, in Florida) asked the cat how she felt. The cat reported: *"pain near left haunch, maybe more intestinal... heat in the chest and dry mouth."*
> 
> The communicator said: *"This is weird — it sounds like she's describing it in Chinese medicine terms."*
> 
> Turns out the cat had been listening to Lindsay study. 🐱

&nbsp;

## Dosing Reference

### Traditional Units

| Unit | PRC Standard | Taiwan Standard |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 Qián 錢 | ~3g | ~3.75g |
| 2 Qián | ~6g | ~7.5g |
| 3 Qián | ~9g | ~11g |

&nbsp;

### Common Ratios in Formulas

- **Equal herbs:** 9:9:9 or 6:6:6
- **Chief herb higher:** 9:6:6
- **Harmonizing herb lower:** 9:9:6 (Gān Cǎo often ~2/3 of others)
- **Dà Zǎo / Shēng Jiāng:** Often dosed by piece/slice, not grams

---

&nbsp;

## Action Items

### For Next Week

- [ ] **Review** Week 2 notes (rest of Spleen formulas)
- [ ] **Memorize** Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng ingredients (4 herbs — it's in the name)
- [ ] **Compare** Lǐ Zhōng Tāng vs. Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng — know the swap and why

&nbsp;

### Study Strategy

> [!tip] Instructor Advice
> *"For many people, this program may be more memorization than you've ever done. I don't want someone who has a great grasp of herbs to flunk because they can't remember ingredients. Work on the underlined formulas. People who like to memorize can memorize everything — that's fine. But if it doesn't come easily, just focus on the underlined ones."*

&nbsp;

### Coming Up

- Stabilizing & Binding herbs (next week)
- More Spleen formulas
- Week 3 content if time permits
