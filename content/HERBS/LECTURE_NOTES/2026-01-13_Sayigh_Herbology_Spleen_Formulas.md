## Summary

This lecture explores the **Stabilize and Bind** category of herbs and walks through the major [[Spleen]] formula family—from the foundational [[Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng]] through its modifications for phlegm, Qì stagnation, and loose stools. The capstone formula [[Bǔ Zhōng Yì Qì Tāng]] addresses the unique presentation of **Qì sinking**.

&nbsp;

> [!important] Core Concept
> The Spleen formula family builds progressively:
> - **Lǐ Zhōng Tāng** → Spleen Yáng deficiency (with cold)
> - **Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng** → Spleen Qì deficiency (base formula)
> - **Liù Jūn Zǐ Tāng** → + dampness/phlegm
> - **Xiāng Shā Liù Jūn Zǐ Tāng** → + Qì stagnation (bloating, pain)
> - **Shēn Líng Bái Zhú Sǎn** → best for loose stools
> - **Bǔ Zhōng Yì Qì Tāng** → Qì sinking

&nbsp;

## Stabilize and Bind 固澀

*Gù Sè*

Stabilize and Bind herbs **restrain discharges**—any fluid or substance leaving the body inappropriately. They can be organized by location:

| Burner | Discharges Addressed | Examples |
|--------|---------------------|----------|
| **Upper** | Sweating, coughing (loss of Lung Qì) | Wǔ Wèi Zǐ |
| **Middle** | Diarrhea, loose stools (Spleen disharmony) | Wǔ Méi, Lián Zǐ |
| **Lower** | Frequent urination, leukorrhea, spermatorrhea | Wǔ Wèi Zǐ |

&nbsp;

> [!warning] Contraindications
> **Stabilize and Bind herbs are primarily for deficiency patterns.**
> 
> Do NOT use for:
> - **Exterior conditions** — would trap the pathogen by preventing sweating
> - **Damp-heat diarrhea** — need to clear heat and drain damp, not hold it in
> - **Blood heat bleeding** — clear heat first; don't trap heat inside
> - **Phlegm-heat cough** — need to clear damp-heat, not stop expulsion

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Root & Branch Strategy
> When diarrhea is severe and deficiency is clear, you can combine tonifying herbs (root) with stabilize & bind herbs (branch) for faster results. This treats both the underlying weakness and the urgent symptom.

## Wǔ Wèi Zǐ 五味子 (Schisandra)

*Five Flavor Seed*

A broad-spectrum stabilize and bind herb affecting **all three burners**. Now popular globally as an "adaptogen."

&nbsp;

### Properties

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Channels** | Kidney, Lung, Heart |
| **Temperature** | Warm |
| **Taste** | Sour (predominant), theoretically all five flavors |
| **Category** | Stabilize and Bind |

&nbsp;

### Functions

| Function | Burner | Application |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Stop cough, restrain Lung Qì leakage | Upper | Chronic cough |
| Stop sweating | Upper | Spontaneous sweating |
| Calm the spirit | Upper/Heart | Restlessness, insomnia |
| Stop diarrhea | Middle | Chronic loose stools |
| Secure essence and urine | Lower | Spermatorrhea, frequent urination |

&nbsp;

> [!note] The Name "Five Flavors"
> Traditionally, different parts contain different flavors:
> - Skin = sweet
> - Flesh = sour
> - Seed = acrid and bitter
> - All parts = salty
> 
> To get all properties, **crush the seed** before decocting. Otherwise sour dominates.

&nbsp;

### Key Combination

**Wǔ Wèi Zǐ + Xì Xīn + Gān Jiāng** — stops cough due to cold

This trio appears in [[Xiǎo Qīng Lóng Tāng]]. The warming, dispersing herbs (Xì Xīn, Gān Jiāng) outweigh the astringent effect, allowing exterior release while Wǔ Wèi Zǐ restrains the cough.

&nbsp;

### Preparations

| Preparation | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Honey-fried | Augments tonifying function |
| Vinegar-fried | Strengthens sour/retaining action |
| Dry-fried | Mild warming |

&nbsp;

## The Gentlemen Formula Family

This family of formulas builds on [[Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng]] as a base, adding herbs to address specific complications of [[Spleen Qì Deficiency]].

&nbsp;

### Lǐ Zhōng Tāng vs. Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng

| | Lǐ Zhōng Tāng 理中湯 | Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng 四君子湯 |
|---|---|---|
| **Pattern** | Spleen Yáng deficiency | Spleen Qì deficiency |
| **Key feature** | **Cold** (worse with cold foods, undigested food in stool) | No pronounced cold |
| **Shared herbs** | Rén Shēn, Bái Zhú, Zhì Gān Cǎo | Rén Shēn, Bái Zhú, Zhì Gān Cǎo |
| **Distinguishing herb** | **Gān Jiāng** (warms) | **Fú Líng** (drains damp) |

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Clinical Pearl
> **Pào Jiāng** (blast-fried ginger) can replace Gān Jiāng in Lǐ Zhōng Tāng when bleeding is present—it specifically stops bleeding while still warming.

&nbsp;

### Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng 四君子湯

*Four Gentlemen Decoction*

The **cardinal formula** for [[Spleen Qì Deficiency]]. Pure tonification—no additional strategies.

&nbsp;

#### Composition

| Herb | Pinyin | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| 人參 | Rén Shēn | Strongly tonify Spleen Qì |
| 白朮 | Bái Zhú | Tonify Spleen, dry dampness |
| 茯苓 | Fú Líng | Strengthen Spleen, promote urination, leach damp |
| 炙甘草 | Zhì Gān Cǎo | Tonify Spleen (honey-fried), harmonize |

&nbsp;

#### Herb Pairs (Duì Yào)

| Pair | Relationship |
|------|--------------|
| **Fú Líng + Bái Zhú** | Both strengthen Spleen; Bái Zhú dries damp, Fú Líng promotes discharge—balanced fluid management |
| **Fú Líng + Zhì Gān Cǎo** | Gān Cǎo is sweet/moistening; Fú Líng is drying—prevents cloying |
| **Rén Shēn + Bái Zhú** | Strongest Qì tonics for the middle burner |

&nbsp;

#### Indications

- Poor appetite
- Loose stools
- Fatigue, limb weakness
- Pale complexion
- Weak pulse
- Pale tongue, possibly white greasy coat

&nbsp;

> [!note] Substitution
> **Dǎng Shēn** commonly replaces Rén Shēn in prepared pills—cheaper (1/4-1/5 cost) and appropriate for most cases.

&nbsp;

### Liù Jūn Zǐ Tāng 六君子湯

*Six Gentlemen Decoction*

**Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng + Èr Chén Tāng** = Tonify Spleen + Resolve Phlegm

&nbsp;

#### Added Herbs

| Herb | Pinyin | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| 半夏 | Bàn Xià | Resolve phlegm, descend rebellious Qì, stop nausea |
| 陳皮 | Chén Pí | Move Qì, dry dampness (prevents stagnation from tonics) |

&nbsp;

> [!important] Key Differentiator
> Use Liù Jūn Zǐ Tāng when there is **actual phlegm** or **rebellious Qì symptoms**:
> - Greasy tongue coat
> - Belching, nausea, vomiting
> - Coughing up phlegm

&nbsp;

> [!warning] More Drying
> Bàn Xià and Chén Pí are quite drying. Make sure dampness/phlegm is truly present—otherwise stick with Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng.

&nbsp;

### Xiāng Shā Liù Jūn Zǐ Tāng 香砂六君子湯

*Six Gentlemen with Aucklandia and Amomum*

**Liù Jūn Zǐ Tāng + Shā Rén + Mù Xiāng** = adds stronger Qì-moving capacity

&nbsp;

#### Added Herbs

| Herb | Pinyin | Category | Key Functions |
|------|--------|----------|---------------|
| 砂仁 | Shā Rén | Transform Dampness | Move Qì, warm middle, descend rebellious Qì, **excellent for nausea** |
| 木香 | Mù Xiāng | Regulate Qì | Move Qì in middle burner and intestines, **best for bloating and abdominal pain** |

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Alan's Preference
> "I use this more than the other two... This is a very broad and generally useful formula for middle burner problems."
> 
> Use when there's **pain, bloating, and Qì stagnation** alongside deficiency.

&nbsp;

#### The Xiāng Family

| Herb | Channel Focus | Best For |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Mù Xiāng** 木香 | Middle burner + intestines | Bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea |
| **Xiāng Fù** 香附 | Liver Qì | Rib discomfort, wiry pulse, stress-worsened digestion |
| **Huò Xiāng** 藿香 | Resolve dampness | When dampness is more pronounced |

&nbsp;

> [!note] Why Add Two Similar Herbs?
> "No two herbs are identical... if you add two of them, you're getting the fringe properties of two herbs that might give you a broader effect than just doubling one."

&nbsp;

## Bǔ Zhōng Yì Qì Tāng 補中益氣湯

*Tonify the Middle and Augment the Qì Decoction*

For **Spleen Qì deficiency with Qì sinking** — when the Spleen can't raise the clear or hold organs in place.

&nbsp;

### Composition

| Group | Herbs | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Tonify Qì** | Huáng Qí (君), Rén Shēn, Bái Zhú, Zhì Gān Cǎo | Strengthen middle burner |
| **Raise the Qì** | Huáng Qí, Shēng Má, Chái Hú | Direct the formula upward |
| **Nourish Blood** | Dāng Guī | Support Qì-blood relationship |
| **Regulate Qì** | Chén Pí | Prevent stagnation from tonics |

&nbsp;

> [!note] Huáng Qí 黃芪 — The Key Herb
> Huáng Qí is the primary tonic herb that **raises Qì**. It tonifies both interior Qì (Rén Shēn's domain) and exterior/Wèi Qì.
> 
> Honey-fried Huáng Qí (蜜炙黃芪) enhances its tonifying function.

&nbsp;

### Guide Herbs for Raising

| Herb | Pinyin | Channel Affinity | Dose |
|------|--------|------------------|------|
| 升麻 | Shēng Má | Yáng Míng | 3g (small—just guiding) |
| 柴胡 | Chái Hú | Shào Yáng | 3g (small—unlike in Xiǎo Chái Hú Tāng) |

&nbsp;

### Three Presentations

| Category | Manifestations |
|----------|----------------|
| **Qì Sinking / Organ Prolapse** | Rectal prolapse, uterine prolapse, hemorrhoids, severe diarrhea, heavy periods, prolonged spotting |
| **Unable to Raise the Clear** | Dizziness, tinnitus, deafness, weak voice, visual disturbances, shortness of breath |
| **Yīn Fire / Qì Deficiency Fever** | Slight feverishness worse with exertion, spontaneous sweating, aversion to cold, prefers warm drinks despite heat sensation |

&nbsp;

> [!important] Yīn Fire Explained
> When Yáng can't rise properly, it stagnates and generates mild heat. The person feels feverish but:
> - Tongue remains **pale**
> - Pulse remains **weak**
> - Fever **worsens with exertion**
> - Prefers **warm drinks**
> 
> This is NOT an excess heat pattern—it's deficiency creating the appearance of heat.

&nbsp;

> [!warning] Contraindication: Exterior Invasion
> Do NOT use during an active exterior condition. Huáng Qí strengthens the exterior—the opposite of what's needed to release a pathogen through sweating.

## Tonification Warnings

> [!danger] Don't Over-Tonify
> Tonification is for **deficiency patterns only**. Taking tonic herbs when not deficient can cause:
> 
> - **Qì stagnation** → bloating, abdominal discomfort
> - **Heat signs** → acne, hypertension, headaches, neck tension
> - **Worsening of excess conditions**
> 
> Traditional advice: "Don't take Rén Shēn until after age 40."

&nbsp;

> [!note] Tonics ≠ Vitamins
> "You're not taking vitamins so that you can eventually build yourself up... The herbs ideally are trying to restore balance and then you wouldn't need to take the herbs anymore."

| 陳皮 | Chén Pí |
| 香附 | Xiāng Fù |
| 五味子 | Wǔ Wèi Zǐ |

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Test Strategy
> "If I was gonna give you a test question that had Bǔ Zhōng Yì Qì Tāng as the answer, there would have to be something that told you the problem was in the Spleen... some Qì sinking type symptom, some digestive symptom."
> 
> If a question just lists fatigue, loose stools, poor appetite, and weak limbs — with nothing about prolapse or inability to raise — **Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng** is likely the answer.

&nbsp;

## Notable Quotes from Lecture

> "Stabilize and bind herbs... are only used in deficiency cases. With excesses, they generally have to be cleared. You have to get rid of something. You don't need to just hold it in."

&nbsp;

> "I use Xiāng Shā Liù Jūn Zǐ Tāng more than the other two... This is a very broad and generally useful formula for middle burner problems."

&nbsp;

> "In real practice, there are people who favor Lǐ Zhōng Tāng and they might just use it where somebody else might use Sì Jūn Zǐ Tāng. For me, I want to see some cold."
