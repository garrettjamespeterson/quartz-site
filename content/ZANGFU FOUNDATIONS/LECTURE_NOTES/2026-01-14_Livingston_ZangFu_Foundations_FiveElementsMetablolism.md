## Study Strategy & Exam Guidance

> [!tip] Dr. Livingston's Study Advice
> *"If you do the reading and come to class and you pay attention, spend a little time studying, you'll pass."*
> 
> Don't rely on PowerPoints — study from the **textbook** (Maciocia). Read and re-read.

&nbsp;

### Recommended Approach

| Resource | Priority | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Maciocia textbook | **Primary** | Read, re-read, memorize core functions |
| Class attendance | **Essential** | Discussion and clarification |
| PowerPoints | Low | Just outlines — book explains better |
| Course objectives | **Reference** | These tell you what to know |

&nbsp;

> [!important] Long-Term Learning
> *"This semester, study it, and next term, and all these three years. Just constantly go back and read and reread and memorize and rememorize."*
> 
> SEAM doesn't systematically teach theory — it's integrated into every class. **Supplement with independent study.**

&nbsp;

### Core Knowledge Priorities

**Must Memorize:**
1. **Functions of each organ** (at beginning of each Maciocia chapter)
2. **Production of qì, blood, and body fluids**
3. **Basic vital substance theory**

> [!warning] Know the "What" AND the "Why"
> Don't just memorize "Heart governs blood." Know **what that means** clinically.

## Kidneys Govern the Two Lower Yīn Orifices

腎主二陰  
*Shèn zhǔ èr yīn*

The [[Kidney|kidneys]] govern and open at the **two lower yīn orifices** (下陰 *xià yīn*):

| Orifice | Location | Functions Governed |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Anterior** (前陰 *qián yīn*) | Urethra / vagina | Urination, holding baby to term |
| **Posterior** (後陰 *hòu yīn*) | Anus / rectum | Defecation, holding stool |

&nbsp;

> [!important] Dual Function of Kidney Qì
> Kidney qì both **secures** (holds in) and **drives** (pushes out) these orifices.
> - **Holding urine** = Kidney qì securing
> - **Pushing urine out** = Kidney qì driving
> 
> *"If you don't believe me, stand on your head and try to pee — you can still do it. Peeing is not just gravity."*

&nbsp;

---

## Qīng Qiào — The Clear Orifices

清竅  
*Qīng qiào*

The **seven orifices of the head** (七竅 *qī qiào*) are called the *clear orifices* because only **clear** (清 *qīng*) substances should ascend there:

- 2 eyes
- 2 ears  
- 2 nostrils
- 1 mouth

> [!tip] Clinical Significance
> If ears feel congested, sinuses blocked, or phlegm accumulates in the throat → **turbid** (濁 *zhuó*) substances have risen where they don't belong.

The body constantly **separates clear from turbid** (清濁分離 *qīng zhuó fēn lí*):
- **Clear** → useful, ascends to upper burner
- **Turbid** → waste, descends to lower orifices

&nbsp;

---

## Upper Burner as Mist

上焦如霧  
*Shàng jiāo rú wù*

The [[Heart]] and [[Lung|lungs]] in the upper burner distribute [[Qi|qì]], [[Blood|blood]], and [[Body Fluids|body fluids]] to all tissues **like a mist**.

> [!example] Why "Mist"?
> - **Rain** → you can shelter under a tree and stay dry
> - **Mist** → penetrates everywhere, even under leaves
> 
> The mist analogy means qì, blood, and fluids reach **every tissue** without exception.

&nbsp;

---

## Waterways vs Water Metabolism

These terms are often confused but refer to different concepts:

| Concept | Chinese | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Waterways** | 水道 *shuǐ dào* | Physical pathways where fluids circulate |
| **Water metabolism** | 水液代謝 *shuǐ yè dài xiè* | Production, circulation, and elimination of fluids |

&nbsp;

### Waterways (水道)

- Anatomically "fuzzy" — *good luck finding them in an autopsy*
- **Emanate from** the [[San Jiao|Sān Jiāo]] (三焦)
- **Governed by** the [[Lung]] (肺主通調水道 *fèi zhǔ tōng tiáo shuǐ dào*)

> [!note] Lung Governs Waterways
> Lung governs [[Qi|qì]]. Qì moves fluids. Therefore, Lung governs the waterways.

&nbsp;

### Water Metabolism

The complete cycle of fluid **production → circulation → elimination**.

| Organ | Role in Water Metabolism |
|-------|-------------------------|
| [[Lung]] | Governs waterways, descends & disseminates fluids |
| [[Spleen]] | Transforms & transports fluids upward |
| [[Kidney]] | **Governs water** (腎主水), fundamental driver |

> [!important] Kidneys Are Fundamental
> The [[Mingmen Fire|Mìngmén fire]] (命門火) resides in the kidneys and provides the yáng qì that **drives** water metabolism.
> 
> Water is very yīn → needs yáng to manage it.

&nbsp;

## Heart Governs vs Spleen Controls Blood

Two completely different functions that get confused in English translation:

| Function | Chinese | Character | Organ | Meaning |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Governs** blood | 心主血 | 主 *zhǔ* | [[Heart]] | Propels blood through vessels |
| **Controls** blood | 脾統血 | 統 *tǒng* | [[Spleen]] | Holds blood within vessels |

> [!warning] Translation Trap
> In Chinese, 主 and 統 are completely different characters with distinct meanings. English translations sometimes use "governs" or "controls" interchangeably — **they are not the same**.

## Five Element Cosmological Diagram

### Original Representation: Earth in the Center

```
              南 South
                火 Fire (Summer)
                  ↑
                  
    東 East                     西 West
    木 Wood    ←    土 Earth    →    金 Metal
    (Spring)       (Center)         (Autumn)
                  
                  ↓
                水 Water
              北 North (Winter)
```

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Orientation Key
> - Emperor faces **south** (南 *nán*)
> - South is at the **top** of Chinese maps (opposite of Western maps)
> - Sun rises in the **east** (東 *dōng*) = left side when facing south
> - Sun sets in the **west** (西 *xī*) = right side

&nbsp;

### Earth Returns at End of Each Season

At the end of each season, qì returns to earth before moving to the next phase:

**Spring (Wood)** → *Earth* → **Summer (Fire)** → *Earth* → **Autumn (Metal)** → *Earth* → **Winter (Water)** → *Earth* → …

> [!quote] Jīn Guì Yào Lüè 金匱要略
> *"At the end of each season, the spleen is strong and isn't prone to sickness."*
> 
> — Zhāng Zhòngjǐng explains why earth/spleen strengthens at seasonal transitions

&nbsp;

## Liver Ascends Left, Lung Descends Right

肝升於左，肺降於右  
*Gān shēng yú zuǒ, fèi jiàng yú yòu*

This statement relates to the **cosmological diagram**, not literal anatomy:

| Element | Direction | Side | Movement | Organ |
|---------|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| Wood 木 | East | Left (sunrise) | Ascending ↑ | [[Liver]] |
| Metal 金 | West | Right (sunset) | Descending ↓ | [[Lung]] |

> [!warning] Not Literal Anatomy
> This does **not** mean liver qì literally ascends on the left side of the body and lung qì descends on the right.
> 
> *"I never heard any old Chinese person say that. I usually don't listen to those people [who claim otherwise]."*

&nbsp;

---

## Shēng and Kè Cycles

### Generating Cycle (生 Shēng)

Normal, healthy, **physiological** relationships:

```
Wood → Fire → Earth → Metal → Water → Wood
 木  →  火  →  土   →  金   →  水   → 木
```

**Mother-child relationship** (母子關係 *mǔ zǐ guān xì*):
- Wood **generates** Fire (母生子 *mǔ shēng zǐ*)
- Fire **generates** Earth
- etc.

&nbsp;

### Controlling Cycle (克 Kè)

Also normal and healthy — **prevents excess**:

```
Wood → Earth → Water → Fire → Metal → Wood
 木  →  土   →  水   →  火  →  金   → 木
```

> [!example] Wood Controls Earth — Clinical Example
> [[Liver]] and [[Gallbladder]] control [[Spleen]] and [[Stomach]]:
> - Liver **free coursing** (疏泄 *shū xiè*) helps Spleen/Stomach function
> - Gallbladder **bile** aids digestion
> 
> Without this controlling relationship, Spleen and Stomach cannot function properly.

&nbsp;

> [!tip] Natural World Analogy
> Trees (wood) grow into earth, aerating the soil with their roots. Without wood, earth becomes too dense, too yīn, unable to support life.

&nbsp;

## Pathological Five Element Relationships

When shēng and kè become dysfunctional:

| Pattern | Chinese | Direction | Meaning |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Disease of mother affects child** | 母病及子 | Along shēng cycle | Weak mother → weak child |
| **Disease of child affects mother** | 子病及母 | Against shēng cycle | Weak child drains mother |
| **Over-controlling** (Overacting) | 相乘 *xiāng chéng* | Along kè cycle (excessive) | Element attacks what it normally controls |
| **Insulting** | 相侮 *xiāng wǔ* | Against kè cycle | Element attacks what normally controls it |

&nbsp;

### Over-controlling (相乘 Xiāng Chéng)

When an element **excessively attacks** what it normally controls.

> [!example] Wood Over-controlling Earth
> **Pathomechanism:**
> - [[Liver]] qì stagnation (肝氣鬱結 *gān qì yù jié*) = Wood excess
> - Liver **overacts** on [[Spleen]] and [[Stomach]]
> - Results: Loss of appetite, digestive issues when stressed
> 
> **Formula:** [[Si Ni San|Sì Nì Sǎn]] (四逆散) — treats Liver qì constraint

> [!tip] Clinical Recognition
> Patient is stressed or emotional → **loses appetite** → Wood overacting on Earth

&nbsp;

### Insulting (相侮 Xiāng Wǔ)

Going **against** the control cycle — the controlled element attacks back.

```
Normal: Metal controls Wood (Metal → Wood)
Insulting: Wood attacks Metal (Wood → Metal)
```

> [!important] Liver Insults Lung — Very Common
> [[Liver]] qì stagnation can:
> - Overact on [[Spleen]]/[[Stomach]] (along kè)
> - **Insult** [[Lung]] (reverse of kè)
> 
> The Liver channel goes to the chest where Heart and Lung reside. Chest tightness from Liver qì stagnation affects both.

&nbsp;

### Example: Disease of Mother Affects Child

> [!example] Spleen Deficiency → Lung Deficiency
> - [[Spleen]] (mother) is weak → can't separate clear from turbid
> - Less [[Qi|qì]] and [[Blood|blood]] produced
> - [[Lung]] (child) doesn't receive nourishment → becomes weak
> 
> *"That's the mother not nourishing the child."*

&nbsp;

### Example: Disease of Child Affects Mother

> [!example] Liver Blood Deficiency → Kidney Deficiency
> - [[Liver]] blood (child) is weak
> - [[Kidney]] (mother) tries to compensate
> - Over time, mother becomes depleted
> 
> *"It's like — my son needs another hundred bucks, oh you need a computer, oh you need a plane ticket..."*

&nbsp;

---

## Clinical Applications

> [!tip] Clinical Thinking Pattern
> When you identify one organ as weak, immediately consider:
> - Is the **mother** also weak? (upstream cause)
> - Is the **child** also weak? (downstream effect)
> - Could there be **overacting** or **insulting**?

&nbsp;

### Case Example: 11-Year-Old with Weak Heart and Lungs

**Presentation:** Young patient with weakness in both Heart and Lung

**Key finding:** Father had the same pattern → **prenatal (先天 *xiān tiān*)** deficiency

**Analysis:**
- Not a case of Spleen failing to nourish Lung → Heart weakness
- Patient has excellent appetite (*"that dude eats, he could eat a horse"*)
- Root cause: **Kidney essence** (腎精 *shèn jīng*) deficiency
- Prenatal weakness manifesting in upper burner organs

> [!important] Lesson
> Always investigate relationships, but don't force Five Element explanations when the actual pathomechanism is different.

&nbsp;

### Case Example: Pediatric Cough

> [!example] Dr. Livingston's Pediatric Teacher in China
> **Setting:** Pediatric clinic, 70-90 patients per morning, 10-20+ cough cases
> 
> **Observation:** Teacher frequently added [[Si Ni San|Sì Nì Sǎn]] to cough formulas
> 
> **Initial confusion:** *"Why is he putting Sì Nì Sǎn in there? He thinks all these little kids have Liver qì stagnation?"*

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Children are **chún yáng** (純陽) | "Pure yáng" — very active, growing fast |
| Spring of their life | In the **Wood phase** — strong Liver energy |
| Liver tends toward hyperactivity | Easily **insults** the Lung |
| Cough treatment | Must address Liver, not just Lung |

> [!warning] Don't Just Treat the Symptom
> *"You could just put herbs in there to stop cough. But that's called 'didn't study well' — don't understand Chinese medicine very well."*
> 
> *"When your patient has a headache, you needle their head. This is an insult."*

> [!quote] Nèijīng 內經
> **治病求因**  
> *Zhì bìng qiú yīn*
> 
> *"To treat disease, search for the root/cause."*

&nbsp;

---

## Treatment Principles vs Treatment Methods

### Zhì Zé (治則) — Treatment Principles

Overarching principles that guide **all** treatment:

> [!important] Key Principle
> **緩則治本，急則治標**  
> *Huǎn zé zhì běn, jí zé zhì biāo*
> 
> - **Moderate situations** → treat the **root** (本 *běn*)
> - **Urgent situations** → treat the **branch** (標 *biāo*)

&nbsp;

### Zhì Fǎ (治法) — Treatment Methods

Specific methods for treating particular pathologies:

| Example Pattern | Treatment Method |
|-----------------|------------------|
| [[Spleen Qi Deficiency]] | Tonify Spleen qì (補脾氣 *bǔ pí qì*) |
| Liver qì stagnation | Soothe Liver, move qì (疏肝理氣 *shū gān lǐ qì*) |
| Blood stasis | Invigorate blood (活血 *huó xuè*) |

> [!tip] Hierarchy
> **Zhì zé** (principles) are **universal** — apply to all treatment
> 
> **Zhì fǎ** (methods) are **specific** — apply to particular patterns

&nbsp;

---

## Seven and Eight Year Cycles of Essence

七八週期  
*Qī bā zhōu qī*

Developmental markers based on [[Jing|essence]] (精 *jīng*) cycles:

| Gender | Cycle Length | Significance |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Women | 7 years | Teeth, hair, fertility milestones |
| Men | 8 years | Teeth, hair, fertility milestones |

> [!note] Function of These Cycles
> Shows the tendency for how men and women **develop and age** — developmental markers, not rigid endpoints.
> 
> *"If you're going to pass away, it will likely happen right at that decade mark. If you make it past, you're good for another decade."*

&nbsp;

## Instructor Quotes

> [!quote] On Chinese Medicine's Nature
> *"Chinese medicine is fuzzy, fuzzy, let you live. Western medicine is clear, clear, let you die."*
> 
> *"Don't ask me how they came up with this stuff. All I know is that Nèijīng says that's the way it is and you just go with it."*
> 
> — Dr. Livingston, quoting his teacher Jeffrey Pong: *"Nèijīng, say so."*

&nbsp;

> [!quote] On Maps and Terrain
> *"These are humans' attempts at understanding the natural world. It's a map. The natural world is the terrain. The maps are trying to represent the terrain, but you can't really represent the terrain with a map."*

&nbsp;

> [!quote] On Five Element Theory's Limits
> *"Five element theory, at least as far as I can tell, doesn't perfectly represent all possibilities... There's all these other ways of understanding pathology. Why would you want to limit yourself to one?"*

&nbsp;

> [!quote] On Complexity
> *"Most people's pathology is very complicated. That's why this is not easy. If everyone's pathology was super easy, then you'd just go to school for a couple months and you'd be golden."*

&nbsp;

> [!quote] On Learning
> *"At the beginning it's super frustrating, but I guarantee you a year from now you'll walk by that room and see the first years and you're just like — I remember being all confused like that."*
> 
> *"You will be knowing."*

*Lecture: Dr. Livingston, Zàng Fǔ Foundations — January 14, 2026*
