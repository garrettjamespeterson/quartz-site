## Overview of Yang Organs (Fǔ 腑)

> [!quote] 《素問》 Sùwèn
> *"The five Zang organs store essence and do not drain; they may be full but cannot be filled. The six Fu organs transform and transport but do not store; they may be filled but cannot be full."*
> — Sùwèn Chapter 11

### Key Characteristics of Fǔ 腑

| Feature | Yin Organs (Zàng 臟) | Yang Organs (Fǔ 腑) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Function** | Store vital substances | Transform & transport |
| **Nature** | Full, not filled | Filled, not full |
| **Qi Movement** | Stores | Drains downward |
| **Pathology** | Deficiency common | Excess/stagnation common |

> [!important] Clinical Pearl
> Yang organs must be kept **unobstructed** — their pathology typically involves stagnation, accumulation, or failure to descend. Treatment focuses on promoting movement and descent.

---

## The Stomach (Wèi 胃)

> [!earth] 土 Earth Element
> Paired with [[Spleen]] (Pí 脾) | Color: #8b5a2b

### Functions of the Stomach

#### 1. Controls Receiving (Shòu Nà 受納)
- Receives food and drink — called the "Sea of Food and Fluids" (**Shuǐ Gǔ Zhī Hǎi** 水穀之海)
- Also called "Sea of Nourishment" (**Cāng Lǐn Zhī Guān** 倉廩之官)
- Capacity to receive = foundation of postnatal [[Qi]]

> [!quote] 《素問》 Sùwèn
> *"The Stomach is the Sea of Water and Grain... it is the great source of the six Fu organs."*
> — Sùwèn Chapter 11

#### 2. Controls Rotting and Ripening (Fǔ Shú 腐熟)
- Initial breakdown/fermentation of food
- Transforms food into **chyme** for Spleen to extract [[Qi]]
- Requires Stomach [[Qi]] and Stomach [[Yang]]

> [!warning] Pathology
> **Stomach Qi Deficiency**: poor appetite, distension after eating, tiredness
> **Stomach Yang Deficiency**: above + cold limbs, preference for warm food/drinks

#### 3. Controls Transportation of Food Essences
- Moves food essences to [[Spleen]] for transformation
- Transports waste downward to [[Small Intestine]]

#### 4. Controls Descending of Qi (Jiàng 降)

> [!important] Key Concept — Stomach Qi Descends
> The Stomach's Qi direction is **DOWNWARD** — this is fundamental to its function and pathology.

**Stomach Qi Descending allows:**
- Food to move to Small Intestine
- Waste to be eliminated
- Proper appetite

**Rebellious Stomach Qi (Wèi Qì Shàng Nì 胃氣上逆):**
- Nausea, vomiting, hiccup, belching
- Sour regurgitation

#### 5. The Origin of Fluids (Jīn Yè Zhī Yuán 津液之源)
- Stomach is the origin of [[Body Fluids]]
- Needs adequate fluids to function (unlike Spleen which is impaired by Dampness)
- Stomach easily develops [[Yin Deficiency]] and Dryness

> [!quote] 《素問》 Sùwèn
> *"The Stomach likes moisture and dislikes dryness."*

#### 6. Mental/Emotional Aspect
- Stomach Qi grounds the Mind ([[Shen]])
- Strong Stomach Qi = mental clarity, good sleep
- Deficient Stomach Qi = confusion, poor concentration, insomnia

### Stomach Relationships

| Relationship | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Spleen** | Earth pair; ST descends, SP ascends — must be harmonized |
| **Kidney** | KI Yang warms ST; KI Yin nourishes ST fluids |
| **Liver** | LV Qi can invade ST causing stagnation |

### Dreams Associated with Stomach
- **Excess**: Dreams of eating, large meals
- **Deficiency**: Dreams of empty stomach, hunger

---

## The Small Intestine (Xiǎo Cháng 小腸)

> [!fire] 火 Fire Element
> Paired with [[Heart]] (Xīn 心) | Color: #c44536

### Functions of the Small Intestine

#### 1. Controls Receiving and Transforming
- Receives transformed food from Stomach
- Further digestion and transformation
- Called "Receiving Official" (**Shòu Shèng Zhī Guān** 受盛之官)

#### 2. Separates the Pure from the Impure (Bié Qīng Zhuó 別清濁)

> [!important] Key Function
> This is the **most important function** of the Small Intestine — separating fluids and nutrients.

**The Pure (Qīng 清):**
- Nutrients → [[Spleen]] → distributed to body
- Pure fluids → Bladder for storage/reuse

**The Impure (Zhuó 濁):**
- Solid waste → [[Large Intestine]]
- Turbid fluids → Bladder for excretion

> [!tip] Clinical Significance
> SI function affects both urination AND defecation:
> - SI Qi deficiency → loose stools + scanty urination
> - Treatment: **Separate clear and turbid** (利小便實大便)

#### 3. Relationship with Heart

The Heart-Small Intestine connection manifests as:
- [[Heart Fire]] can transfer to SI → burning urination, blood in urine
- Mental-emotional stress (Heart) → digestive upset (SI)

> [!warning] Classic Pattern
> **Heart Fire Transferring to Small Intestine**: mental restlessness + dark/painful urination + mouth ulcers

---

## The Large Intestine (Dà Cháng 大腸)

> [!metal] 金 Metal Element
> Paired with [[Lung]] (Fèi 肺) | Color: #d68910

### Functions of the Large Intestine

#### 1. Receives Waste from Small Intestine
- Called "Official of Transportation" (**Chuán Dǎo Zhī Guān** 傳導之官)
- Further absorbs remaining fluids

#### 2. Excretes Feces
- Transforms waste into stool
- Defecation requires:
  - LI Qi to move waste
  - Adequate fluids to moisten
  - [[Lung]] Qi descending to assist

### Large Intestine Pathology

| Pattern | Symptoms |
|---------|----------|
| **Damp-Heat** | Diarrhea, mucus/blood in stool, urgency, burning anus |
| **Heat** | Constipation, dry stool, thirst |
| **Cold** | Loose stool, borborygmus, cold abdomen |
| **Dryness** | Dry stool, difficult defecation |
| **Qi Stagnation** | Alternating constipation/diarrhea, abdominal distension |

### Large Intestine Relationships

> [!important] Lung-Large Intestine Relationship
> - [[Lung]] Qi descends to promote LI function
> - Lung Qi deficiency → weak defecation
> - LI obstruction → impairs Lung descending

**Clinical Application:** Purging LI can treat Lung patterns (acute asthma, high fever)

## The Gall Bladder (Dǎn 膽)

> [!wood] 木 Wood Element
> Paired with [[Liver]] (Gān 肝) | Color: #27ae60

### Special Status
> [!note] Extraordinary Yang Organ
> The Gall Bladder is unique — it is both a regular Fǔ AND an Extraordinary Yang Organ because it stores bile (a pure substance) rather than waste.

### Functions of the Gall Bladder

#### 1. Stores and Excretes Bile (Dǎn Zhī 膽汁)
- Bile = refined surplus from Liver
- Aids digestion of fats
- Requires smooth flow of [[Liver Qi]]

> [!warning] Pathology
> - Damp-Heat in GB → bitter taste, jaundice, nausea
> - GB Qi stagnation → pain in hypochondrium, sighing

#### 2. Controls Judgment and Decision (Zhōng Zhèng Zhī Guān 中正之官)

> [!quote] 《素問》 Sùwèn
> *"The Gall Bladder is the official of what is just and exact; determination and decision stem from it."*
> — Sùwèn Chapter 8

- Liver plans, Gall Bladder decides
- GB deficiency → timidity, indecision, easily startled
- GB excess → recklessness, aggression

#### 3. Controls Sinews (with Liver)
- GB Qi nourishes [[Sinews]] at night
- Deficiency → restless sleep, waking easily

### Gall Bladder Relationships

| Organ       | Relationship                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Liver**   | Interior-exterior; LV provides bile, GB stores/excretes |
| **Heart**   | GB affects courage → influences Heart/Shen stability    |
| **Stomach** | GB Damp-Heat can affect ST → nausea, vomiting           |

### Dreams Associated with Gall Bladder
- **Deficiency**: Dreams of fighting, trials, suicide
- **Excess**: Dreams of anger, rage

---

## The Bladder (Páng Guāng 膀胱)

> [!water] 水 Water Element
> Paired with [[Kidney]] (Shèn 腎) | Color: #2d5a7b

### Functions of the Bladder

#### 1. Removes Water by Qi Transformation (Qì Huà 氣化)

> [!important] Key Concept
> The Bladder's function depends entirely on [[Kidney Yang]] (Mìng Mén 命門) to provide Qi transformation.

**Process:**
1. Fluids arrive from SI, LI, LU (via Water Passages)
2. Kidney Yang provides Qi transformation
3. Pure part → recycled upward
4. Impure part → excreted as urine

#### 2. Stores and Excretes Urine

- Storage requires Kidney Qi to "hold"
- Excretion requires Bladder Qi and Kidney Yang
- Called "Official of a Region" (**Zhōu Dū Zhī Guān** 州都之官)

### Bladder Pathology

| Pattern                | Symptoms                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Damp-Heat**          | Frequent, urgent, burning urination; dark urine     |
| **Damp-Cold**          | Frequent, pale urination; heaviness                 |
| **Kidney Yang Xu**     | Profuse, clear urination; weak stream; incontinence |
| **Kidney Qi Not Firm** | Enuresis, incontinence, dribbling                   |

### Bladder Relationships
- **Kidney**: Entirely dependent on KI Yang for function
- **Lung**: LU governs Water Passages → sends fluids down to BL
- **Spleen**: SP transforms fluids → affects BL fluid reception
- **Triple Burner**: SJ is the "waterway" through which fluids travel

---

## The Triple Burner (Sān Jiāo 三焦)

> [!fire] 火 Fire Element
> Paired with [[Pericardium]] (Xīn Bāo 心包) | Color: #c44536

> [!quote] 《難經》 Nànjīng
> *"The Triple Burner has a name but no form."*
> — Nànjīng Chapter 38

### Special Characteristics

The Triple Burner is unique — it is:
- The largest of all organs
- Has "name but no form" (function without definite structure)
- Coordinates the functions of all Zang-Fu

### Functions of the Triple Burner

#### 1. Mobilizes the Original Qi (Yuán Qì 元氣)

> [!important] Key Function
> The Triple Burner acts as the **avenue for Original Qi** — it distributes Yuán Qì from the Kidneys to all organs.

- Original Qi emerges between the Kidneys
- SJ transports it to all organs via channels
- Each organ needs Yuán Qì for its specific function

#### 2. Controls the Water Passages (Shuǐ Dào 水道)

> [!quote] 《素問》 Sùwèn
> *"The Triple Burner is the official in charge of irrigation; the Water Passages stem from it."*
> — Sùwèn Chapter 8

- Regulates transformation, transportation, excretion of fluids
- Coordinates LU, SP, KI, BL fluid metabolism
- Called the "Sluice Official" (**Jué Dú Zhī Guān** 決瀆之官)

#### 3. Controls Transportation and Penetration of Qi
- Qi enters (into organs) and exits (to surface)
- Ascending Qi and Descending Qi
- The "thoroughfare" for Qi movement

### The Three Burners (Upper, Middle, Lower)

| Burner | Location | Organs | Function | Metaphor |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Upper (Shàng Jiāo 上焦)** | Above diaphragm | HT, LU, PC | Distributes fluids like mist | "Like a Mist" 如霧 |
| **Middle (Zhōng Jiāo 中焦)** | Epigastrium | SP, ST | Transforms food/fluids, "fermentation" | "Like a Foam" 如漚 |
| **Lower (Xià Jiāo 下焦)** | Below umbilicus | KI, BL, LI, SI, LV | Separates pure/impure, excretes | "Like a Swamp" 如瀆 |

> [!tip] Memory Aid: "Mist, Foam, Swamp"
> - Upper = mist (disperses like fog)
> - Middle = foam (bubbling/churning transformation)
> - Lower = swamp (drainage/filtration)

### Clinical Application

| Pattern | Location | Symptoms |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Upper Jiao obstruction** | Chest | Cough, chest oppression, breathlessness |
| **Middle Jiao obstruction** | Epigastrium | Fullness, poor appetite, nausea |
| **Lower Jiao obstruction** | Lower abdomen | Urinary difficulty, edema, constipation |
